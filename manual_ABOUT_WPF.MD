# What is WPF?

WPF, which stands for **Windows Presentation Foundation**, is Microsoft's latest approach to a GUI framework, used with the .NET framework.

But what is a GUI framework? GUI stands for Graphical User Interface, and you're probably looking at one right now. Windows has a GUI for working with your computer, and the browser that you're likely reading this document in has a GUI that allows you to surf the web.

A GUI framework allows you to create an application with a wide range of GUI elements, like labels, textboxes and other well known elements. Without a GUI framework you would have to draw these elements manually and handle all of the user interaction scenarios like text and mouse input. This is a LOT of work, so instead, most developers will use a GUI framework which will do all the basic work and allow the developers to focus on making great applications.

There are a lot of GUI frameworks out there, but for .NET developers, the most interesting ones are currently WinForms and **WPF**. **WPF** is the newest, but Microsoft is still maintaining and supporting WinForms. As you will see in the next chapter, there are quite a few differences between the two frameworks, but their purpose is the same: To make it easy to create applications with a great GUI.

## <ins>WPF vs. WinForms</ins>

The single most important difference between WinForms and WPF is the fact that while WinForms is simply a layer on top of the standard Windows controls (e.g. a TextBox), WPF is built from scratch and doesn't rely on standard Windows controls in almost all situations. This might seem like a subtle difference, but it really isn't, which you will definitely notice if you have ever worked with a framework that depends on Win32/WinAPI.

A great example of this is a button with an image and text on it. This is not a standard Windows control, so WinForms doesn't offer you this possibility out of the box. Instead you will have to draw the image yourself, implement your own button that supports images or use a 3rd party control. With WPF, a button can contain anything because it's essentially a border with content and various states (e.g. untouched, hovered, pressed). The WPF button is "look-less", as are most other WPF controls, which means that it can contain a range of other controls inside of it. You want a button with an image and some text? Just put an Image and a TextBlock control inside of the button and you're done! You simply donâ€™t get this kind of flexibility out of the standard WinForms controls, which is why there's a big market for rather simple implementations of controls like buttons with images and so on.

The following is a completely subjective list of the key advantages for WPF and WinForms. It should give you a better idea of what you're going into.

### _WPF advantages_

- It's newer and thereby more in tune with current standards
- Microsoft is using it for a lot of new applications, e.g. Visual Studio
- It's more flexible, so you can do more things without having to write or buy new controls
- When you do need to use 3rd party controls, the developers of these controls will likely be more focused on WPF because it's newer
- XAML makes it easy to create and edit your GUI, and allows the work to be split between a designer (XAML) and a programmer (C#, VB.NET etc.)
- Databinding, which allows you to get a more clean separation of data and layout
- Uses hardware acceleration for drawing the GUI, for better performance
- It allows you to make user interfaces for both Windows applications and web applications (Silverlight/XBAP)

### _WinForms advantages_

- It's older and thereby more tried and tested
- There are already a lot of 3rd party controls that you can buy or get for free
- The designer in Visual Studio is still, as of writing, better for WinForms than for WPF, where you will have to do more of the work yourself with WPF

## <ins>Visual Studio Community</ins>

WPF is, as already described, a combination of XAML (markup) and C#/VB.NET/any other .NET language. All of it can be edited in any text editor, even Notepad included in Windows, and then compiled from the command line. However, most developers prefer to use an IDE, since it makes everything, from writing code to designing the interface and compiling it all so much easier.

The preferred choice for a .NET/WPF IDE is Visual Studio, which costs quite a bit of money though. Luckily, Microsoft has decided to make it easy and absolutely free for everyone to get started with .NET and WPF, so they have created a free version of Visual Studio, called Visual Studio Community. This version contains slightly less functionality than the real Visual Studio, but it has everything that you need to get started learning WPF and make real applications.

So go and download Visual Studio Community from Microsoft - it's free and easy to install and use:
